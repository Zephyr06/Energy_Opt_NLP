# Energy_Opt_NLP
This repo implements energy optimization for real-time systems based on nonlinear programming, and explores special structure to achieve efficient optimization.

# RoadMap
1. warm start on response time during optimization;
can we bound the incremental response time analysis?
1.5 order of variables in GTSAM, should the Jacobian be a upper or a lower triangular matrix?
2. incremental optimization
3. DAG optimization
